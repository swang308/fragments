# CCP555 NSA course - fragments API

Update the README.md file to include instructions on how to run the various scripts you just created (i.e., lint, start, dev, debug). Include everything you think you might forget. You're going to spend a lot of time working in this code, so it's a good idea to document everything you can. Good docs are better than faulty memories! Marks will be deducted if your README is incomplete.
